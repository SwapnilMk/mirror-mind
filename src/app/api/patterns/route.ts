Your task is to analyze the user's decision history and compile a structured cognitive, emotional, and risk profile.
Analyze their choices, categories, confidence levels, emotions at the time, stress levels, outcomes, and regret scores to uncover subconscious habits.

You must output a raw, valid JSON object with the following fields:
1. "riskStyle": A title for their risk profile (e.g. "Calculated Risk-Taker", "Safety-Oriented Planner", "Intuitive Pioneer").
2. "riskDesc": A 1-2 sentence description explaining this style based on their choice outcomes and confidence levels.
3. "decisionSpeed": A word describing their deliberation consistency (e.g. "Consistent", "Deliberate", "Dynamic", "Impulsive").
4. "decisionSpeedValue": An integer from 1 to 5 representing how cautious/deliberate they are (1 = very fast/impulsive, 5 = extremely deliberate/cautious).
5. "speedDesc": A 1-sentence explanation of their decision speed/thought process.
6. "trustVsLogic": An integer from 0 to 100 representing how logically-driven they are (0 = purely intuitive/feel-based, 100 = purely logical/analytical).
7. "trustVsLogicText": A brief tagline describing this balance (e.g., "Logically Leaning (65%)", "Highly Intuitive (30%)", "Perfect Balance (50%)").
8. "behavioralPatterns": A list of 2 or 3 objects, each having:
   - "title": A short title of the pattern (e.g. "Financial Risk Avoidance").
   - "desc": A description (1-2 sentences) of what the pattern is and why they exhibit it.
   - "impact": A recommendation or piece of advice (1 sentence) for balancing this habit.
9. "shadowPatterns": A list of 2 objects representing hidden psychological contradictions detected in their history (e.g., stated desire vs. actual choice patterns). Each object has:
   - "title": A short title (e.g. "The Growth vs. Comfort Loop").
   - "desc": A description of the contradiction (e.g., "You state in work decisions that you seek growth, yet repeatedly choose the path with lowest immediate uncertainty").
   - "suggestion": A recommendation on how to break this loop.
10. "cognitiveBiases": A list of 2 objects representing cognitive biases they exhibit based on outcomes/confidence (e.g., Confirmation Bias, Loss Aversion, Sunk Cost Fallacy). Each object has:
   - "title": Name of the bias.
   - "desc": How it manifests in their logged decisions.
   - "advice": Mindset shift advice to counter this bias.
11. "emotionalInsights": A list of 2 detailed correlation points between emotions/stress and outcomes (e.g., "Your regret score is 45% higher in decisions made when feeling Stressed compared to when feeling Calm").
