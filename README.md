## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `>= 18.x`
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- A PostgreSQL database (e.g. [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), [Neon](https://neon.tech/), or local)
- An AI API key from [freemodel.dev](https://api.freemodel.dev) (or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint)

---

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SwapnilMk/mirror-mind.git
cd mirror-mind

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

---

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and fill in the values:

```dotenv
# ─── Database ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Connection URL used by Prisma (with connection pooling, e.g. PgBouncer on Supabase)
DATABASE_URL=""

# Direct connection URL (used for Prisma migrations — bypasses pooler)
DIRECT_URL=""

# ─── Auth ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A random secret string used to sign/encrypt NextAuth session tokens
# Generate one with: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=""

# The base URL of your app (change for production)
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# ─── AI ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Your API key from freemodel.dev (or any OpenAI-compatible provider)
AI_API_KEY=""

# Base URL for the AI provider
AI_BASE_URL="https://api.freemodel.dev"

# The model to use for AI inference
AI_MODEL="claude-sonnet-4-6"
```

> **Tip:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The `.gitignore` already excludes it.

---

### Database Setup

Run the Prisma migration to set up your database schema:

```bash
# Push schema to your database (for development)
npx prisma db push

# Or run migrations (for production-style workflow)
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# (Optional) Open Prisma Studio to inspect your data
npx prisma studio
```

---

### Running the App

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Open in your browser
# http://localhost:3000
```

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start
```

## 📡 API Reference

### `POST /api/ai/reflect`

Send a journal entry or question to the AI and receive a thoughtful reflection.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "message": "I'm struggling to decide whether to switch careers.",
  "history": []
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "reply": "That's a significant crossroads. Let's break down what's pulling you in each direction..."
}
```

## ☁️ Deployment

The easiest way to deploy MirrorMind is via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/):

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the repository in Vercel
3. Add all environment variables from your `.env` under **Project Settings → Environment Variables**
4. Deploy!

For the database, set `DATABASE_URL` to a pooled connection string and `DIRECT_URL` to the direct (non-pooled) connection string — required for Prisma to run migrations correctly on Vercel.
